# PythonForm/Appiform/Apy

A first Python Form project that takes your information and converts it into your units of choice.
Welcome to the instructions and requests of PythonForm created by Knivier, the creator of the project.

PythonForm will now be referred to by its original name, "Appiform" or "Apy" in short. 

Apy's original goal was to create a simple base template to take basic user information. The form would be able to do simple conversions and dump the data into a JSON file.

The new version of Apy gives the form more legibility, and more features including a GUI that takes user input, as opposed to the terminal that would originally be the input source for questions. This GUI is TKinter-based with simple modifications that allow for better GUI representations. Additionally, a unique UUID is created with the JSON file dump every time a data dump occurs (once the form has finished with execution).

Finally, arbitrary inputs have been removed, variables have been slightly modified, and formatting for print statements has been also changed.



Overall, Update 2.0 and continued gives Appiform a new and more refined base template that can be used and modified by first-year Python learners (or even sooner). 

Usage Recommendations:

You must credit me (Knivier) and if you choose to copy code into a separate Github, you must fork the code as opposed to downloading and uploading the code to Github without fork tracings. You must not add code with an intent to:

Wreak havoc on user computer systems by taking advantage of exploits
Steal confidential user data
Take information for advertisement purposes
Additionally, to comply with federal law, you are recommended not to take user information that may breach HIPPA (the US Federal Health Information Protection Laws). Users that you ask for information from are recommended to be above the age of 13 and unless you are a licensed medical professional, you are not recommended to ask questions that may breach HIPPA laws or ask any medical questions at all. 

This project is SFW-based meaning all contents and form questions must be PG/PG-13. You are not recommended to ask questions related to consent laws, weapons, drugs (of any type), and other questions for users aged above 16, regardless of the age recommended of 13 for intake information.

The UUID created during JSON dumps is specific to that form, but isn't tagged. It's a unique ID that has no connections with any personal information given in the intake form including:

Age
User Name
Advertisement intake forms are not recommended. You are not recommended to modify this form to add questions that will be linked to advertisers, to comply with user privacy. 

These guidelines are only recommended and cannot be enforced by me (Knivier), the developer. However, as a statement, I do not condone the actions of any misintent within this code including the breaches of privacy laws, HIPPA regulations, hacks or malicious code with intent to steal user data or information taken for advertisement purposes. 

This message serves as a reminder that different countries have different laws about different regulatory items, however, these serve as a general guideline that you are recommended to follow. You are subject to your country of residence laws.
